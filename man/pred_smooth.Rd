\title{Predict a univariate or bivariate smooth term from an sdmTMB model over uniform intervals}
\usage{
pred_smooth(object, smooth = NA, n = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{\link[=sdmTMB]{sdmTMB()}} model.}

\item{n}{The number of equally spaced points to evaluate the smoother along. Factor variables, used with the \verb{by=} syntax
will be evaluated at each unique factor level}

\item{select}{The smoother term to plot as a character, e.g. "s(year)", "s(year,depth)", etc. Smooths that are entered in the
formula as being grouped by a factor, "s(depth,by=year)" need to be entered using a \code{:}, e.g.
"s(depth_scaled):year"}
}
\description{
Predict a univariate or bivariate smooth term from an sdmTMB model over uniform intervals
}
\details{
Note:
\itemize{
\item Any numeric predictor is set to its mean
\item Any factor predictor is set to its first-level value
\item The time element (if present) is set to its minimum value
\item The x and y coordinates are set to their mean values
}

if (inla_installed()) {
  d <- subset(pcod, year >= 2000 & density > 0)
  pcod_spde <- make_mesh(d, c("X", "Y"), cutoff = 30)
  m <- sdmTMB(
    data = d,
    #formula = log(density) ~ s(lat,depth_scaled,by=year),
    #formula = log(density) ~ s(depth_scaled,by=year),
    formula = log(density) ~ s(depth_scaled),
    mesh = pcod_spde
  )
  ps <- pred_smooth(m, "s(depth_scaled)")
  # call to gratia is then gratia::draw(ps)
